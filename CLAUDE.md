# CLAUDE.md

## Scope
Keep changes focused on explicit task requirements and avoid speculative rewrites.

## Workflow
- Understand the task before editing code.
- Prefer small, reviewable changes with clear intent.
- Preserve existing architecture and conventions unless a refactor is explicitly requested.

## Code Quality
- Keep code readable, typed, and production-ready.
- Add concise comments only when intent is not obvious from code.

## Git Guidelines
- Use feature branches for all non-trivial changes.
- Use Conventional Commit messages for every commit.
- Require pull requests with human review before merging.

## Delivery Guidelines
- Run relevant tests before considering the task complete.
- Keep changes within the requested scope and avoid unrelated rewrites.
